MIR-ST500 dataset

Version: 2021.02.06

Description
MIR-ST500 dataset is a dataset created by NTU MIRLAB for the task of "automatic singing transcription".
This dataset contains 500 pop songs and the corresponding annotations of VOCAL parts.
For more information, please refer to the paper "On the Preparation and Validation of a Large-scale Dataset" (ICASSP2021).

Data Format
"MIR-ST500_link.json" contains Youtube links of these 500 songs (in dictionary structure of {id:link}). You can download corresponding audio from Youtube using these links.
"MIR-ST500_corrected.json" contains annotations of these 500 songs. It is a dictionary of {id:gt}. Here, "gt" is a list of ground truth notes (in ascending order of the onset). Each note is denoted by [onset, offset, score pitch].
"metadata.csv" contains labeler id (1~14) and verifier id (1~6) of each song in the dataset.

Each song has its own id numbering from 1 to 500. We separate these 500 songs into training set (#1 to #400) and test set (#401 to #500).
If some of the Youtube links do not work, please contact us (especially for those songs in test set !!!).
